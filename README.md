# MeerTRAP Misc Software #

This repository contains software pieces for the MeerTRAP project at the MeerKAT telescope. Most of the code is developed in `Python 3` (and in particular version >3.7), but `Python 2` (e.g. version 2.7) should work fine.

Each software has its own README file that describes it.
